# Simpleadmin for Foxconn T99W175

Static web interface (HTML/JS with Bash CGI helpers) to administer Foxconn T99W175 modem. This version is heavily inspired by the work at [iamromulan/quectel-rgmii-toolkit](https://github.com/iamromulan/quectel-rgmii-toolkit) has some heavy edits to make it work with the T99W175 and some changes that i thought would make it better for us.

## Quick overview
- Responsive HTML pages (Bootstrap 5 + Alpine.js) served from the modem web partition.
- Bash CGI scripts in `www/cgi-bin/` that drive AT commands, Watchcat, TTL override, and utility actions.
- Front-end settings via `www/config/simpleadmin.conf`.

Check [DOCUMENTAZIONE.md](DOCUMENTAZIONE.md) for file-by-file behavior, request flows, and how each page uses the CGI helpers.

Simpleadmin is designed to run directly on the Foxconn T99W175 inside the modem’s web partition.
Follow these steps to deploy it safely.


1 Download or clone the repository

2 Extract the ZIP and locate the www folder

3 Connect via SSH to the modem (default IP: 192.168.225.1, default user: root)

4 Locate the webserver folder and inside it find the current www directory

5 Delete or rename the existing www folder

6 Upload the freshly downloaded www folder from the repository

7 Give the www folder recursive 777 permissions:

## Troubleshooting
Ssh password not known : connect the modem via usb and install needed driver if windows doesnt automatically , then connect to adb using adb shell and run passwd , then you can change root password , and you can use that to access ssh.
